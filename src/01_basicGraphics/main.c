/*
 * In this tutorial we're going to initialize the GPU, set it up and display
 * some simple hardware-rendered graphics (namely, a shaded triangle).
 *
 * While the PS1's GPU may appear complicated and daunting, its principle of
 * operation is in actual fact very simple. At a high level it is simply a
 * "rasterization machine" capable of drawing triangles, quads, rectangles and
 * lines in 2D space (with 3D transformations being entirely the CPU's
 * responsibility) and of displaying a rectangular cutout of its 1024x512x16bpp
 * framebuffer, which resides in dedicated memory (VRAM). It is controlled using
 * only two registers, one (GP0) for drawing commands and the other (GP1) for
 * display control and other commands; we're going to see how to configure the
 * video output and draw our triangle by writing the right commands to these
 * registers.
 *
 * This tutorial will use the ps1/gpucmd.h header file I wrote, which contains
 * enumerations and inline functions for all commands supported by the GPU. If
 * you wish to write such a header yourself, you'll want to check out the
 * GPU register and command documentation at:
 *     https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/graphicsprocessingunitgpu
