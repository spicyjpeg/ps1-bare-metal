/*
 * In the previous two examples we saw how to control the GPU and draw graphics
 * by writing commands directly to the GP0 and GP1 registers. While this
 * approach is simple and easy to understand, it also limits performance: the
 * CPU always has to wait for the GPU to go idle before being able to send it a
 * new command, otherwise the GPU may miss it; similarly, the GPU can only
 * process commands while the CPU is actively feeding it.
 *
 * To get around these limitations the GPU (along with most of the PS1's other
 * peripherals) can instead be given access to RAM and read GP0 commands from it
 * automatically, without needing the CPU to feed it. This is accomplished
 * through a middleman peripheral known as the direct memory access (DMA)
 * controller, and is the key to high-performance graphics on the PS1. We'll see
 * how to allocate a buffer in RAM, fill it with commands and then set up the
 * GPU's DMA channel to read from it in the background while we're preparing the
 * next frame's command buffer.
