# This is a minimal implementation of a function to flush the CPU's instruction
# cache. While a similar function is already present in the BIOS ROM, this
# version is several orders of magnitude faster as it only clears the tags (the
# BIOS implementation unnecessarily zeroes out the contents of every cache line)
# and is not subject to the waitstates imposed by the ROM's 8-bit bus.
